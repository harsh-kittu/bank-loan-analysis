# üè¶ Bank Loan Analysis Project

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of bank loan data using **MS SQL Server**. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan applications, funded amounts, and received payments are calculated to assess the health of the loan portfolio. This analysis is further visualized using **Power BI** to make informed data-driven decisions.

---

## üìä Project Dashboards

The analysis is supported by interactive dashboards that summarize the findings and provide detailed insights into the loan portfolio:

- **Summary Dashboard**  
  ![Bank Loan Summary](https://harsh-kittu.github.io/bank-loan-analysis/report-images/bank_loan_summary.png)

- **Overview Dashboard**  
  ![Bank Loan Overview](https://harsh-kittu.github.io/bank-loan-analysis/report-images/bank_loan_overview.png)
  
  - **Details Dashboard**  
  ![Bank Loan Details](https://harsh-kittu.github.io/bank-loan-analysis/report-images/bank_loan_details.png)

These dashboards offer a visual representation of KPIs, loan performance, and key metrics for quick insights into lending activities.

MTD_Loan_Applications = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(bank_loan_data[id]),
    DATESMTD(bank_loan_data[issue_date])

Good_Loan_Percentage = 
    (COUNTROWS(FILTER(bank_loan_data, bank_loan_data[loan_status] = "Fully Paid" || bank_loan_data[loan_status] = "Current")) 
    * 100.0) / COUNTROWS(bank_loan_data)
```
- **Explanation**: Calculates the percentage of good loans that are either fully paid or current.

### 17. **Bad Loan Percentage**
```DAX
Bad_Loan_Percentage = 
    (COUNTROWS(FILTER(bank_loan_data, bank_loan_data[loan_status] = "Charged Off"))

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **MS SQL Server**:  
   - Used for writing complex queries to extract, clean, and aggregate loan data.
   - Key SQL operations include `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and filtering data by month and loan status.
  
- **Power BI**:  
   - Connected to SQL Server to create interactive dashboards for data visualization.
   - Used DAX for advanced calculations and to create visual reports on KPIs, trends, and loan performance.
